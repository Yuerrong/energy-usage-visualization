# energy-usage-visualization
A small Python project demonstrating data cleaning and visualization for monthly energy usage. Created as a small portfolio example for data analytics and automation.


## What These Project Does
- Energy_Consumption_Analysis_Tool.ipynb: Input monthly usage data, through input() to input datasets as shown in the document and visualises results.
- Sql-to-python-energy-visualisation.ipynb: Input sqlite3 to connect database to extract data.
- Calculates total consumption for each type of energy
- Generates different types of charts using Matplotlib
- Demonstrates for data processing and visualization

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Sqlite3
- Matplotlib

##  Purpose
Created a small portfolio sample to demonstrate:
- The ability to input datasets, extract data from database and analyse datasets
- Basic automation and visualisation skills
- Good documentation and clean project structure
